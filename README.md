# Operation-Analytics-Investigating-Metric-Spike
Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike 

  
 
Project Description: 
           Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company.      With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. 
           Being one of the most important parts of a company, this kind of analysis is further used to understanding between cross-functional teams, and more effective workflows.  
 
            Investigating metric spike is also an important part of operation analytics as being a Data Analyst we must be able to understand or make other teams understand questions like- Why is there a dip in daily engagement? Why have sales taken a dip? Etc. Questions like these must be answered daily and for that it’s very important to investigate metric spike. 
            I am working for a company like Microsoft designated as Data Analyst Lead and is provided with different data sets, tables from which I must derive certain insights out of it and answer the questions asked by different departments. 
             The things that we are going to find out through the projects are: 
•	Number of jobs reviewed 
•	Throughput 
•	Percentage share of each language 
•	Duplicate rows 
•	User Engagement 
•	User Growth 
•	Weekly Retention 
•	Weekly Engagement 
•	Email Engagement 
 
Approach: 
      Firstly, I spent some time on understanding the data/table given. I cleared the questions which was in my mind like what does the job_id, actor_id, event means and what are the things to consider while reviewing the data.
      I use SQL to derive different insights from the dataset provided by the management team. I first created a database “operation_analytics” and then the tables using the structure and links provided by the team.
      Then, we performed analysis to generate valuable insights for the company. 
 

Tech-Stack Used: 
•	MySQL Workbench (Version 8.0 CE): MySQL Workbench provides data modelling, SQL development, and various administration tools for configuration. It also offers a graphical interface to work with the databases in a structured way.
It is easy and free to use MySQL to create a database and perform analysis answering the questions given in the description. 
•	Mode.com: It perform advanced analytics quickly and deliver valuable insights. It does not required any download and installation. We can connect our data warehouse with Mode. I performed case study 2 (investigating metric spike) in Mode. 
•	Microsoft Word 2021: It is used to make a report (PDF) to be presented to the leadership team. 
 
Insights: 
Case Study 1 (Job Data): 
•	The number of distinct jobs reviewed per hour per day for November 2020 is 83%. 
•	We used the 7-day rolling average of throughput as it gives the average for all the days right from day 1 to day 7 whereas, daily metric gives the average for only that particular day itself. 
•	The percentage share of Persian language is the most (37.5%). 
•	There are two duplicate rows if we partition the data by job_id. But if we look the overall columns, all the rows are unique. 
 
Case Study 2 (Investigating metric spike): 
•	The weekly user engagement increased from week 18th to week 31st and then started declining from then onwards. This means that some of the users do not find much quality in the product/service in the last of the weeks. 
•	There are in total 9381 active users from 1st week of 2013 to the 35th week of 2014. 
•	The overall count of weekly engagement per device used is the most for MacBook users and iPhone users. 
•	The email opening rate is around 34% and email clicking rate is around 15%. The users are engaging with the email service which is good for the company to expand. 
 
Result: 
In this project, I learned how to apply advanced SQL concepts like Windows Functions, etc. I understood how the real-world industry works.
It helped me in mastering my SQL concepts.  I learned how to ask the right questions given the circumstances. From the given data and questions, which columns to consider and how to find the valuable insights which help the business to grow.
I learned how the company find different areas related to the company to improve it further. I got to know about investigating metric spike (why there is a boom and why there is a dip).
